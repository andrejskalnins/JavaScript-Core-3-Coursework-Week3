# Code reading

## Question 1

Take a look at the following code:

```
1    let x = 1;
2    function f1()
3    {
4        let x = 2;
5        console.log(x);
6    }
7    console.log(x);
```

Explain why line 4 and line 6 output different numbers.

A: Because of local and global scope.

## Question 2

Take a look at the following code:

```
let x = 10

function f1()
{
    console.log(x)
    let y = 20
}

console.log(f1())
console.log(y)
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
The first console log on line 34 calls the function f1 which console logs the global variable x displaying in the console 10.
Second console log on line 35 will return undefined because it is outside of the scope of the function f1 and therefore cannot access variable y value.

## Question 3

Take a look at the following code:

```
const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}

f1(x);
console.log(x);

const y = { x: 9 };

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}

f2(y);
console.log(y);
```

What will be the output of this code. Explain your answer in 50 words or less.
On line 55 the console log will return 9 because it is assigned as a const variable.
Next the output on line 65 will be {x: 10} because Object properties are mutable even when using a const variable, however the reference to that Object stays immutable.
